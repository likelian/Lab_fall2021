Three challenges in automatic mixing:

* objective evaluation, no one single way to approach a good mix
* different plugins used in practice
* interdependency between audio effects in the signal chain

Current output parameters:

1. Loudness difference between the vocal track and the backing track
2. dynamic range of the vocal track
3. Loudness difference between the vocal track and the backing track in each frequency band


To-Do:
1. define the question
2. define a set of output parameters
3. get dataset
4. define ground truth
5. the baseline system (voice power spectrum estimate?)
